            Removed Limestone Wall

Version 4.0 - The Great Redo:
- Updated code to use a more efficient method, it's been mostly rewritten now. 
- Any icons that have an inventory icon now usues it's vanilla icon image.
- All items now have a setting to hide them, and a new persistance option has been added. This makes it so icons only appear when within range, and will disappear when not in range.
